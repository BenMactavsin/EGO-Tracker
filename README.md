# EGO Route Tracker
A repository that saves EGO route data periodically to compare the difference since the last one.

## Why?
Because they seem to forget to report route changes from time to time and it's starte to get a bit annoying.

## Where is the code?
The code is not open-source because it includes a Github PAT token that I'm pretty sure I would unintentionally leak in one day so I decided to not make it open source for the time being.
